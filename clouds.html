        The way I like to visualize what happened to me is by picturing a brain that’s slowly being taken over by a dark cloud. In the times that only a fraction of my mind was stuck under the vapor, intrusive thoughts could be ignored, loneliness could be drowned out, and panic could be played off. The spread wasn’t always consistent; this cloud would creep up and down as she saw fit for the past five years of my life. <br><br>
        Shit hit the fan in March, when the aggressive cloud I’d managed to keep hidden in my head since middle school decided to bust her way out all at once. Okay, I take that back. In the weeks before, there was a multitude of cracks forming in my protective shell. Whether I noticed them or not? Who’s to say, really. Vapor leaked out in so many ways: jokes became more realistic, preparations for a future were minimal, and I found myself slowly convincing my tired brain that loved ones will find a way to be alright without me. <br><br>
        A specific memory I have from this time is from a few days before my shell shattered completely. In a last-minute leap away from the tendrils of teenage boredom, my beloved girlfriend and I decided to go to our friend Cassie’s house to make instant-bake cookies and debrief on the latest high school happenings. Sitting on her kitchen floor as our cookies baked, stroking Cassie’s tiny dog asleep in my lap, listening to our favorite songs while we laughed and braided each other’s hair, I was content. But the cloud craves chaos. Despite being amid a wonderful moment with the people I love, the only thought in my mind was, “They’ll be okay without me.”<br>
    </h5>
    <h4> 
        The cloud does this, she ruins the few enjoyable moments you can manage to grasp while stuck under her reign. She makes everything about herself.<br>
    </h4>
    <h5>
        The night that she managed to make my brain her own, I seemed fine. I’d just had a therapy appointment that I thought went just as well as they normally do. (Listening back to that session six months later, it was clear that I was declining at a speed faster than I had ever before. That’s the thing about the cloud, when she’s in charge, you don’t get to know she exists.) I headed up to bed that night around 9 or 10 and couldn’t fall asleep no matter what I did. The thought consuming my ability to sleep? It was the persistent mantra that if I kept going, it was never going to stop. I was always going to feel like this, it would only get worse.<br><br>
        Now, the little therapist voice in my present mind is asking the question, “What is ‘it?’” The better question, truly, is what isn’t it? “It” was everything that made me want to borrow under my bed covers and never see the light of day again. “It” was the knowledge that I was (still am lol) in the happiest relationship of my life, yet I still was selfish enough to think about taking myself off this earth and leaving her alone. “It” was the cloud herself, even though I didn’t know her yet.<br><br>
        After hours of fighting the cloud as she battled for her final frontier, she began to gain more and more ground. My plan was in place; it was quick and easy, just five feet away in my desk drawer. I put the finishing touches on the note I’d been drafting for months. Some of it wasn’t even intended for specific people, it was just putting words out into the universe as some sort of feeble attempt at an apology for what I had to do.<br><br>
        In the moments before the cloud captured her final frontier, my mind fired out one last defensive shot against her. I went across the hall to the bathroom, and just stood there, looking at my red, puffy face in the mirror for the better part of an hour. As I stared at a person I barely recognized, I realized. “If I don’t ask for help after leaving this bathroom, I’m going to die tonight.” Feeling stuck, I dreaded having to show anyone, even my family, that I was less than okay. Far from it, actually.<br><br>
        So I did it. I fired back at her again and asked for help. Okay, it was really more of a blubbering “pleasedon’tleavemealoneimgonnakillmyself,” type of situation, but I still asked for help nonetheless. The one thing that fucking cloud told me not to do. Trust me, it wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows from that point forwards. Far from it, actually. It sucked. It didn’t get better for a long time, and it took me up until very recently to have the insight to be glad that I fought back against the cloud.<br><br>
        She’s still there of course, being held at bay by journaling, therapy, my girlfriend and friends, my stupid cat, and oh yeah, meds. It took a long time to get to this point, I even ended up spending the most crucial month of senior year in the hospital, just trying to “fall in love with living,” whatever that means. I’ve definitely fallen in love with parts of living? So maybe that’s a start.<br>

        I don’t think the cloud will ever totally go away, maybe everyone has their own version of her, always lurking. I guess falling in love with living includes learning how to be okay even on cloudy days.<br><br>
        To the right is a picture taken not even an hour after I was released from my two-week inpatient stay in a psychiatric unit. Things do get better :)
