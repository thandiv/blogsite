    <h3 class = "movedek">A disorder that most assume to affect only elementary-age boys is an unrecognized obstacle for many university students. </h3>
    <h5 class = "text2" >Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, more commonly known as ADHD, is a psychiatric disorder with a wide range of symptoms that typically appear in a child between ages 3 and 12; these symptoms often include inattention, hyperactivity, sensory issues, emotional dysregulation, and more. When a child with ADHD is put into an educational setting, the results will often include frustration and discouragement for all involved, since modern learning environments are designed solely for the neurotypical brain and its learning habits. If this child chooses to advance onto higher education after their high school career, they will often face unfortunately similar learning circumstances and challenges on the path to earning their degree.</h5>
    <h5 class = "text3">Something that many people with ADHD report struggling with is a thought process known as <a href = "https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/imposter-syndrome">Imposter Syndrome</a>; it convinces the victim that they aren’t as capable as others perceive them to be and causes the victim to live in fear of being discovered as a fraud. When students with ADHD are thrown into an academically rigorous setting, Imposter Syndrome can quickly swoop in and convince them that they don’t deserve to be there, or that they aren’t smart enough to keep up with the neurotypical scholars surrounding them.<br><br>
        When a student has grown up struggling with academic tasks such as reading and writing because of their ADHD, it is easy to fall into the spiral of believing that they don’t deserve to be in a room with those who claim to have started reading before they could crawl.  This is one of the many reasons that students with ADHD struggle in higher education, because they will often convince themselves that they simply aren’t smart enough or gifted enough to complete their degree. The fear of being called out as a “fraud” is often too much.

    <h5 class = "text4">
        When someone is first diagnosed with ADHD, doctors or parents often have the same goal in mind: management through medication. While this is often an effective solution for those struggling with inattention and hyperactivity, it does not address the root cause of these struggles: learning environments throughout the modern education system lack accessibility for neurodiverse students.<br><br>
        In conversation with <a href = "https://ds.oregonstate.edu/">Disability Access Services</a> Advisor Martha Smith at Oregon State University, Smith commented on how many universities are beginning to implement the “round classroom” concept for larger class sizes. In her opinion, these rooms are extremely detrimental for students struggling to focus during a lecture, mainly because the circular concept makes it so that “there isn’t a central spot to focus on,” and causes students to “feel like other people are looking at them.” This is just one example from the exhaustive list of classroom practices that negatively impact neurodiverse students.<br><br>
        Smith’s role as an advisor for DAS is very student-centered, and her main focus is advocating for students with disabilities in academic settings. Many of the students she advises at Oregon State University have ADHD and come to her seeking guidance about potential accommodations that can be made to help them succeed in earning their degree, despite any symptoms that might get in their way.

        Smith’s role as an advisor for DAS is very student-centered, and her main focus is advocating for students with disabilities in academic settings. Many of the students she advises at Oregon State University have ADHD and come to her seeking guidance about potential accommodations that can be made to help them succeed in earning their degree, despite any symptoms that might get in their way.<br><br>
        According to Smith, the most common accommodations that DAS provides to students with ADHD are different notetaking capabilities, digital audiobooks of any assigned readings for their classes, and extended testing time for exams and quizzes. These adaptations to a student’s learning plan make it so that an educational system that wasn’t designed for the student’s brain is a little more accessible for the student in question.  <br><br>
        Accommodations throughout the K-12 system are typically implemented through individual 504 or IEP plans, but accommodations at the university level are organized somewhat differently. Plans such as the ones used in the K-12 system don’t transfer over to OSU; instead, any student with a disability that is requesting accommodations will meet with a DAS advisor and set up an individualized list of academic accommodations to use in their classes. In Smith’s experience, about fifty percent of students who seek out disability accommodation during their first year of college will connect with an advisor about a third of the way through the school year to start the process.<br><br>
        In order to receive accommodation, a student must provide documentation of a disability and explain how it impacts them academically. Afterward, a committee of DAS advisors will determine what accommodations the student is eligible for and help them through the process of implementing those accommodations.
    </h5>
    <h5 class = "text6">
        For students with ADHD in an academic setting, accommodations can make a world of a difference in terms of absorbing and understanding the material, paying attention during lectures, and levels of performance on exams. When it comes to test-taking, OSU offers vital accommodation to many types of students in the form of its Alternative Testing Center in Heckart Lodge. Smith recalls that the center offers reduced distractions, earplugs and noise-cancelling headphones, visual clocks and timers, and pre-approved playlists for students to listen to while taking the tests. This is a wonderful example of what a neuro-divergent education setting can look like, and how it can help a multitude of students achieve their academic goals.
    </h5>
    <h5 class = "text7">
        One student at OSU, Emilia Price, has struggled with modern academic setups in the past because of their ADHD, and states that lack of motivation is one of the biggest struggles they face in college. “It comes in waves I can’t control,” they explained. Many ADHD students struggle with procrastination, and Price agreed that this is a huge problem for them. “My assignments are always done RIGHT at the deadline,” they said, further cementing this theory.<br><br>
        When asked if they had ever utilized accommodations at the K-12 level or OSU, Price responded that they had considered using DAS to receive accommodations for their anxiety, but never got around to it and never started the process. This speaks volumes about the amount of OSU students that don’t know how to begin the accommodations process, and it’s likely that many students with disabilities such as ADHD would struggle much less academically if they were given the proper resources to accommodate their personal needs. Accommodation can be the difference between a student earning their degree and a student giving up on school because modern academic systems were not built for them and their neurodiversity.<br><br>
        A lesser talked about symptom of ADHD is the onset of <a href = "https://www.verywellhealth.com/sensory-overload-and-adhd-5209861#:~:text=What%20does%20sensory%20overload%20feel,expectations%20at%20school%20or%20work.">sensory issues</a>, which can affect almost every aspect of a person’s life. When it comes to food, there are worlds of different flavors and textures out there; if you’re a person with sensory issues, this is extremely intimidating. Of course, sensory issues aren’t a cut-and-dry concept; each person has highly individualized tolerances and dislikes, and what is repulsive to one person with sensory issues may be a safe food to another.
    </h5>
    <h5 class = "text8">
        A commonly known fact about university students is that their diets are sub-optimal; this is due to many different factors such as limited funds, minimal variety, crazy schedules, and lack of structure due to life transitions. When you add sensory issues into the equation, college students with ADHD almost don’t stand a chance against eating less than they should each day. Take Price, for example, who reported that they struggle with a strong dislike of fruits and vegetables due to the varying and unpredictable textures and had to deal for years with people telling them that they need to stop being such a picky eater.
    </h5>
    <h5 class = "text9">
        The truth is sensory issues are out of a person’s control. When it impacts a student’s diet so greatly, it can make learning and studying much more difficult than it already was for them. When the body consumes less calories than it burns throughout the day, a survival instinct within the brain automatically shuts down all non-essential functions within the body in order to decrease energy output and conserve the few calories that the body has consumed.<br><br>
        Unfortunately for those with ADHD and sensory issues, “non-essential” functions can sometimes include different cognitive functions that help with learning. This means that when a student is running on less food than their body needs, their academics will begin to suffer as their brain focuses less on absorbing information and more on conserving energy and surviving. Another reality around food and ADHD is that sometimes, eating just gets forgotten. Since college is often the first time that students are living on their own, there often aren’t authority figures around to remind students with ADHD to eat, or to keep track of how a student is eating and sleeping.<br><br>
        Sleep is another vital part of the brain’s cognitive functioning, this means that a lack of sleep can quickly lead to decreased ability to study, learn, and absorb information. According to a medical article published by <a href = "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2656292/">Paula Alhola</a>, "The decrease in attention and working memory due to (sleep deprivation) is well established." In addition, procrastination is a significant issue for many students with ADHD, and it means that these students are all too often staying up into the night, working on projects that are due the next day. When an ADHD brain is trying to function while being sleep-deprived, symptoms will be magnified and make learning feel ten times more difficult. This has the potential to loop back to the concept of Imposter Syndrome, because when those with ADHD feel as though they aren’t cognitively functioning in the moment, their mind can easily interpret that into a mantra convincing themselves that they aren’t smart enough.<br><br>
        An important aspect of ADHD to recognize while discussing its academic struggles is the strengths that those with the disorder possess. According to Smith, one of the main strengths of students with ADHD is their creativity. Being able to think outside the box is a trait that isn’t as commonly recognized in the academic world as it should be, and this is a place where ADHD brains shine!<br><br>
    </h5>
    <h5 class = "text10">
        The concept of <a href = "https://www.choosingtherapy.com/adhd-hyperfixation/">hyper fixating</a> is another thing that people with ADHD are very familiar with. To hyper fixate or hyperfocus on something means that someone is focused on something that provides them with large levels of dopamine. In order to keep chasing the dopamine, someone with ADHD will continue to be focused on this thing for as long as it provides them with dopamine, this can often be for hours on end! This is such a strength for students with ADHD, because once they find something that they are passionate about, they will learn everything they can about it until it stops providing them with dopamine!
    </h5>
    <h5 class = "text11">
        As a college student with ADHD, learning and working to earn my degree in a setting that wasn’t designed for my brain type is intimidating and exciting all at once. Services such as DAS at OSU are vital in the success of neurodiverse students in higher education, and we have made great strides in making classroom settings more accessible for students like me. There is always more work to be done, and I am extremely excited to see what the future holds.
